download Solr from
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/5.1.0
extract it to any folder you prefer
visit http://localhost:8983/solr/ to see it's going ok
put "solr" folder to solr-5.1.0/server
put "cloud" folder to solr-5.1.0/example
(you don't need them in the project folder anymore)
go to solr-5.1.0/bin and execute: solr start -e cloud -nopromt
when it asks about replacing log files, choose all
it opens two windows. don't close them until you don't need solr anymore!
if somesing doesn't work try running "solr restart -all" from the same bin folder
to stop it run solr stop -all or close those two windows
